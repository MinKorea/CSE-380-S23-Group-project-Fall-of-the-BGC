            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
          
            <p>This document describes a game called "Fall of the BGC" which is designed to be a top-down roguelike game that will use custom music, tilemaps, enemy, and player sprites. You have to challenge defeating enemies and the final boss. Have fun!
            </p>
          <br />
          
            <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>
          
            <p>Fall of the BGC will be made using a game engine called Wolfie2D which uses Typescript. Tilemaps and Tiles will be created using Piskel and Tiled. </p>
          <br />
          
            <h3>BACK STORY</h3>
          
            <p>The Bad Guys Corporation(BGC) has done lots of very very bad things whatever you imagine. And the boss overworks his employees every day. The Smith bros and employees overworked every day got suddenly kicked out from the BGC. So, the family requests the Good Guys Corporation (GGC) to get their money back. The Player, whose name is Good Guy Lukas, has been given a mission by the GGC to take down the BGC.
            </p>
          <br />
          
            <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
          
            <p>The playerâ€™s mission is to enter the BGC headquarters and take out the CEO of the BGC found on the 3rd floor of the tower, but in order to get to the top of the headquarters the player must traverse the floors of the tower and take out whatever enemies lie in their path using the weapons they buy from the shops in the building or just their fists.</p>
          
            <br />
          
            <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>
          
            <p>The player will begin their mission on the first floor of the building, their starting weapon is just their fists which they can use to attack enemies. On each floor there are rooms and these rooms are categorized into 3 types. There are enemy rooms, shop rooms, and boss rooms.
            </p>
             <ul>
                <li>Enemy rooms: There are 3 enemy rooms per floor. These rooms consist of enemies that want to attack you. On the first floor there will be 3-5 enemies, second floor 5-7, third floor 7-9.
                </li>
                <li>Shop rooms: These rooms are a safe space where you can purchase new weapons and abilities using money that the enemies drop when you defeat them.
                </li>
                <li>Shop rooms: These rooms are a safe space where you can purchase new weapons and abilities using money that the enemies drop when you defeat them.
                </li>
                <li>Boss rooms: These rooms are where you can fight the boss on the floor. Beating the boss gives you access to go to the next floor.                    
                </li>
             </ul>
          
            <p>On each floor, there will be 3 enemy rooms, 1 shop room, and 1 boss room, but it can be changed flexible.
            </p>
          
            <p>The acid-protective suits have a strange effect on the room and as a result the balloons. And so, depending on the suit being worn by Spike, the balloons will behave differently as follows:</p>
          
            <br />
          
            <h3>CONTROLS</h3>
